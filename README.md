# Blog Summarizer using Hugging Face Transformers
This project leverages the power of Hugging Face Transformers to create a blog summarizer that can extract and condense content from web pages into concise, meaningful summaries. By combining state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques with web scraping tools, the summarizer provides a quick and efficient way to understand the essence of lengthy blog posts.

## Libraries and Tools
  1. Hugging Face Transformers: Provides pre-trained models for text summarization tasks.
  2. BeautifulSoup: A Python library for parsing HTML and extracting data from web pages.
  3. Requests: A simple HTTP library for making web requests to fetch blog content.
